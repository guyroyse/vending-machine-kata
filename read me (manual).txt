Welcome to the Vending Machine App!

I wrote this in C# and use WPF to design its UI.
Also, it can be done in UWP (Universal Windows Platform) app,
however, it seems no necessary and maybe not convenient to you.
==================================================================

Manual

1. You can find the file "Vending_Machine_WPF.exe", in the path "\Vending_Machine_WPF\bin\Release", double click to run.

2. The UI maybe different due to the system theme, I attached a figure to show my UI.

3. You can press any button you like to test this vending machine, however, to buy products, please follow the next step.

4. Buy Product: 
a) There are 3 kinds of coins, press any one to insert 1 coin of the kind you choose.
b) Click the product to buy the product you want. If the money is enough, you will get the products. If not, vending machine will show how much you should insert.
c) After purchase the product, don't forget to take it and the changes.

5. Thank you to use this Vending Machine App!
